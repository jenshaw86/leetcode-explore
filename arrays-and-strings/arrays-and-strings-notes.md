# Arrays and Strings
An array is a collection of elements stored sequentially in memory. You can access elements randomly, which means that elements can be accessed by index. 

Arrays can be linear (one-dimensional) or multi-dimensional. 

## What is the difference between an array and dynamic array?
An array is typically fixed-capacity or static, which means that the length is fixed and you cannot open more room for more arrays. 

Dynamic arrays on the other hand are of variable size. They can re-adjust to make more space for more elements. 
Javascript arrays are dynamic arrays. 
C# Arrays are fixed-capacity, but Lists behave like dynamic arrays.
