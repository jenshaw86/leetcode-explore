# Binary Trees

A tree is a hierarchical data structure that looks a lot like a real-life tree in the sense that it has a root, branches, leaves, and nodes. 

A tree has a root node which contains references to child nodes. Node references in a binary tree point to, at most, two children, a left and a right node.

# Tree Traversals
There are various ways to traverse a tree. We can do this via depth-first search or breadth first search. 

There are 3 types of depth-first traversals. In-order, pre-order, post-order. 

## Pre-order
- root, left, right

## In-order
- left, root, right

## Post-order
- left, right, root
