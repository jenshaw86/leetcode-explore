# Recursion
Recursion is an approach to solving problems. We do this by using a function that calls itself. 

Each time we make a recursion call, we are solving a subproblem, and we continue to make recursion calls until the subproblem can be solved without further recursion.

To prevent infinate recursion, we need to establish a **base case** or terminating  scenario where further recursion is no longer necessary to solve the problem. We also need to establish **recurrence relation**, which is a set of rules that lead us towards the base case.
