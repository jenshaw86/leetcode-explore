# Linked Lists

## Intro

**Linked lists** are a sequence of nodes, each one containing a *value* reference and at least one pointer or reference to another node. In the case of a **singly linked list**, it would have a *next* pointer that would point to the following node in the sequence from the current node.

A linked list has a head reference which points to the beginning of the list.

## Linked List Operations
Typically a linked list includes the following operations:
1. Add/Insert a node
2. Delete/Remove a node
3. Get/Search a node (value)
4. Display the list

It would also be convenient to split Add into three separate operations:
1. Add a node to the head
2. Add a node to the tail
3. Add a node at a given index
